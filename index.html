      <h5>Research Interests</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Application of Machine Learning in Bioinformatics</li>
        <p>
          I am passionate about leveraging machine learning, particularly deep learning,
          to address complex problems in bioinformatics and computational biology.
          <br />
          My focus lies in developing algorithms to analyze and interpret biological data
          with high precision, contributing to advancements in genomics and personalized medicine.
        </p>

        <li>DNA Classification and Genomic Analysis</li>
        <p>
          The classification and analysis of DNA sequences are central to my research.
          I aim to design innovative machine learning models that can decode
          patterns in genomic data, enhancing our understanding of genetic variations
          and their implications for health and disease.
        </p>

        <li>Large Language Models (LLMs) in Genomics</li>
        <p>
          Exploring the application of LLMs in genomic data processing fascinates me.
          <br />
          These models offer potential in areas like DNA sequence annotation, functional prediction,
          and uncovering latent patterns in large-scale biological datasets.
        </p>

        <li>High-Dimensional Data Analysis</li>
        <p>
          Advancements in spatial omics and single-cell analysis are revolutionizing computational biology.
          By applying deep learning to these high-resolution datasets, I aim to uncover patterns in cellular processes 
          and disease mechanisms, paving the way for breakthroughs in understanding cellular heterogeneity and therapeutic innovations.
        </p>

        <li>Generative Deep Learning</li>
        <p>
          Learning complex, high-dimensional data distributions is a useful and
          fundumetally important task in ML. This is a really exciting and
          beautiful area.
        </p>
      </ul>
